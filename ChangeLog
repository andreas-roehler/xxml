	* xxml.el (xxml-split-long-tags): Revert the 2002-11-05 change,
	moving the equal sign back into xxml-value-regexp.  It breaks
	to many other things.

2002-11-07  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* xxml.el (xxml-html-highlight-tag-alist): And related.  Move
	textually earlier so to avoid compilation diagnotics.

2002-11-06  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* xxml.el (xxml-write-file-hooks-routine): New.

2002-11-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* xxml.el: Change the first comment line so it is compliant with
	Info node (elisp) Library Headers.
	Reported by Stephen Eglen.

	* xxml.el (xxml-font-lock-keywords): Used xxml- named variables
	for all faces, so they could get overridden by users.
	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

	* xxml.el (xxml-value-regexp, xxml-attribute-for-highlight):
	Move the equal sign out of the regexp representing the value.
	Reported by Julian Scheid.

	* xxml.el: Various defvar and autoload declarations, against
	warnings while byte-compiling.
	(xxml-fill-region-sub): Added handle-text optional argument,
	so the variable is not merely bound in the calling function.
	(xxml-attempt-merge, xxml-shrink-wrap): Added terminated argument,
	so the variable is not merely bound in the calling function.
	Reported by Christoph Conrad.
